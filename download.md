<ul><li>
  <a href="https://github.com/darrenmothersele/ofxEditor">ofxEditor</a> - a text
  editor for live coding with openFrameworks. Based a little on ofxGLEditor that
  was used in the initial versions of Cyril, but with more emphasis on using the
  openFrameworks API.
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/darrenmothersele/ofxBeat">ofxBeat</a> - a
simple beat detection library with 32 bands of FFT and separate detection
of kick, snare and hihat. A fast but basic aproach to beat detection.</li>
</ul>


## Running...

I don't have a Mac developer account yet, so the application isn't
signed. This means you wont be able to open it straight away. Here's
how to run the app...

### Download and extract...

<img src="img/extract.png" alt="">

You get the Cyril app downloaded. If you double click to run this
you would see this warning...

<img src="img/warning.png" alt="">

But you can't run it! Instead command click and select open...

<img src="img/open_menu.png" alt="">

You get a different warning this time, but select open and Cyril will start.

Press `COMMAND` + `f` to get into full screen mode. Press `ESC` to exit.
