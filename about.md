title: About Cyril - Live Coding Visuals
---

<p class="lead">
Cyril is a programming environment for live coded visuals. It is very
much inspired by the excellent work of Davide Della Casa and Guy&nbsp;John
at <a href="http://livecodelab.net/">LiveCodeLab</a>.</p>

I met Davide and Guy at Mozilla Festival and got the idea to adapt what
they had created for use in an art installation piece I was working on. When
I failed to get WebGL running on the Raspberry Pi I decided instead to adapt
what I had done using some ideas from LiveCodeLab.

##Â About the author

Cyril was created by Darren Mothersele. It was originally designed for
creating visualisations for an EEG (brain wave) powered art instalation
but is now available as a fully fledged live coding environment.

## Roadmap

Here's what to look forward to in the near future:

 * Bug fixes
 * Lights (almost working)
 * Sprites (almost working)
 * Better loading and saving (file management)
 * Sub-routines for more complex shapes
 * Some sort of safety command in case you accidentally create an infinite loop
 * OSC control provides variables that can be controlled using touch controllers and other devices
 * settings.xml for configuration
