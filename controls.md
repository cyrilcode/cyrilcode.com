Cyril current starts up in a 640x480 window, but you probably want to
press `COMMAND + f` to get into full screen mode.

 * Save buffer to file: `COMMAND + S`

 * Switch buffer: `COMMAND + #` where `#` is a number between 1-9
 * Toggle editor: `COMMAND + a`
 * Toggle fullscreen: `COMMAND + f`
 * Quit: `ESC` or `COMMAND + q`
 * Copy: `COMMAND + c`
 * Paste: `COMMAND + v`
 * Recompile and run current buffer: `COMMAND + r`
 * Clear buffer: `COMMAND + n`
 * Toggle lights: `COMMAND + k`
 * Show/hide cursor: `COMMAND + o`
 * Pause program: `COMMAND + p`

When you save or load a buffer a `data` folder is created to store the text files.
